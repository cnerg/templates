## Available Templates and Themes as Branches

## Contributing
To contribute a theme or template, add it as a separate branch with a branch name that is specific about what it's used for (e.g. poster) and some description of the theme (if any). The `README` for each branch should describe how the template or theme can be used. When a new branch is created, it should be listed in the `README` for the master branch under the appropriate section (e.g. poster, presentation, etc) with a brief description.

Pull requests to update existing templates and themese are welcome.
