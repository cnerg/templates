Intriguingly, the value of 16/5 asserted by the House of Representatives of the State of Indiana in 1897 is still viable, although strongly disfavored relative to 22/7, another popular value. The oft-used `small-circle' value of 3 is ruled out at greater than 5{\textbackslash}sigma.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4206},
	abstract = {We introduce the `Complete Wave Function' and deduce that all living beings, not just Schroedinger's cat, are actually described by a superposition of `alive' and `dead' quantum states; otherwise they would never die. Therefore this proposal provides a quantum mechanical explanation to the world-wide observation that we all pass away. Next we consider the Measurement problem in the framework of M-theory. For this purpose, together with Schroedinger's cat we also place inside the box Rasputin's cat, which is unaffected by poison. We analyse the system identifying its excitations (catons and catinos) and we discuss its evolution: either to a classical fight or to a quantum entanglement. We also propose the \$BSV{\textbackslash}Psi\$ scenario, which implements the Complete Wave Function as well as the Big Bang and the String Landscape in a very (super)natural way. Then we test the gravitational decoherence of the entangled system applying an experimental setting due to Galileo. We also discuss the Information Loss paradox. For this purpose we consider a massless black cat falling inside a massive black hole. After that we outline a method to compute the contribution of black cats to the dark matter of the universe. Finally, in the spirit of Schroedinger, we propose that next generation double-slit experiments should use cats as projectiles. Cat interferometry will inevitably lead to the `Many Cats' interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, allowing to shed new light on old mysteries and paradoxes. For example, according to this interpretation, conservative estimates show that decision making of a single domestic cat will create about 550 billion whole universes every day, with as many replicas of itself.},

	abstract = {We use a feed-forward artificial neural network with back-propagation through a single hidden layer to predict Barry Cottonfield's likely reply to this author's invitation to the "Once Upon a Daydream" junior prom at the Conard High School gymnasium back in 1997. To examine the network's ability to generalize to such a situation beyond specific training scenarios, we use a L2 regularization term in the cost function and examine performance over a range of regularization strengths. In addition, we examine the nonsensical decision-making strategies that emerge in Barry at times when he has recently engaged in a fight with his annoying kid sister Janice. To simulate Barry's inability to learn efficiently from large mistakes (an observation well documented by his algebra teacher during sophomore year), we choose a simple quadratic form for the cost function, so that the weight update magnitude is not necessary correlated with the magnitude of output error. Network performance on test data indicates that this author would have received an 87.2 (1)\% chance of "Yes" given a particular set of environmental input parameters. Most critically, the optimal method of question delivery is found to be Secret Note rather than Verbal Speech. There also exists mild evidence that wearing a burgundy mini-dress might have helped. The network performs comparably for all values of regularization strength, which suggests that the nature of noise in a high school hallway during passing time does not affect much of anything. We comment on possible biases inherent in the output, implications regarding the functionality of a real biological network, and future directions. Over-training is also discussed, although the linear algebra teacher assures us that in Barry's case this is not possible.},

Despite great demand for the resolution of many scientific debates over the taxonomy of food, past attempts have failed to account for complex phase behavior and co-existence, and have thus left the public hungry for a more substantial theory. By applying the principles of statistical physics and thermodynamics, we here map out the complete phase space of all culinary dishes and find three distinct phase regimes: Soup, Salad, and Sandwich. We consider the effect of different state variables on these phase boundaries, as well as regions of co-existence and triple points. With this complete 3-dimensional phase diagram of all foods, we can conclusively answer many bitter debates, including the imperishable question "is a hotdog a sandwich?" The answer: yes.},

Chester first assesses preliminary establishments for causality, including mutual information, temporal precedence, and control for third variables. These assessments are all inconclusive for various reasons. In particular, mutual information fails to illuminate the problem due to a dearth of information regarding what the laser pointer might have been doing at times following Chester's first awareness of the dot. Next Chester performs a formal reconstruction of phase space via time-delay embedding, to unfold the gggggggggggfffgfgtredvteometry ,mmmm.........,.,,......,.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm of the underlying dynamical system giving rise to the red dot's trajectory. The resulting attractor does not resemble a laser pointer. The reconstruction could, however, be flawed, for example, due to the short temporal duration of the dot's observed trajectory. Finally, the red dot could be a hallucination: a symptom brought on by COVID-19 - because, well, these days pretty much anything might be a symptom brought on by COVID-19. On this note, Chester's kitten brother Mad Dog Lapynski offers an independent check on the red dot's existence.

	abstract = {As a modern musician and cultural icon, Taylor Swift has earned worldwide acclaim via pieces which predominantly draw upon the complex dynamics of personal and interpersonal experiences. Here we show, for the first time, how Swift's lyrical and melodic structure have evolved in their representation of emotions over a timescale of \${\textbackslash}tau{\textbackslash}sim14\$ yr. Previous progress on this topic has been challenging based on the sheer volume of the relevant discography, and that uniquely identifying a song that optimally describes a hypothetical emotional state represents a multi-dimensional and complex task. To quantify the emotional state of a song, we separate the criteria into the level of optimism (\$H\$) and the strength of commitment to a relationship (\$R\$), based on lyrics and chordal tones. We apply these criteria to a set of 149 pieces spanning almost the entire repertoire. We find an overall trend toward positive emotions in stronger relationships, with a best-fit linear relationship of \$R=0.642{\textasciicircum}\{+0.086\}\_\{-0.053\}H-1.74{\textasciicircum}\{+0.39\}\_\{-0.29\}\$. We find no significant trends in mean happiness (\$H\$) within individual albums over time. The mean relationship score (\$R\$) shows trends which we speculate may be due to age and the global pandemic. We provide tentative indications that partners with blue eyes and/or bad reputations may lead to overall less positive emotions, while those with green or indigo-colored eyes may produce more positive emotions and stronger relationships. However, we stress that these trends are based on small sample sizes, and more data are necessary to validate them. Finally, we present the taylorswift python package which can be used to optimize song selection according to a specific mood.},

	abstract = {The Bachelor is a reality TV dating show in which a single bachelor selects his wife from a pool of approximately 30 female contestants over eight weeks of filming (American Broadcasting Company 2002). We collected the following data on all 422 contestants that participated in seasons 11 through 25: their Age, Hometown, Career, Race, Week they got their first 1-on-1 date, whether they got the first impression rose, and what "place" they ended up getting. We then trained three machine learning models to predict the ideal characteristics of a successful contestant on The Bachelor. The three algorithms that we tested were: random forest classification, neural networks, and linear regression. We found consistency across all three models, although the neural network performed the best overall. Our models found that a woman has the highest probability of progressing far on The Bachelor if she is: 26 years old, white, from the Northwest, works as an dancer, received a 1-on-1 in week 6, and did not receive the First Impression Rose. Our methodology is broadly applicable to all romantic reality television, and our results will inform future The Bachelor production and contestant strategies. While our models were relatively successful, we still encountered high misclassification rates. This may be because: (1) Our training dataset had fewer than 400 points or (2) Our models were too simple to parameterize the complex romantic connections contestants forge over the course of a season.},

While primordial Black Holes would appear to be very good candidates for inducing the SHC phenomenon, we show that the estimated local Dark Matter density requires that the particles have masses of \${\textbackslash}sim 10\${\textbackslash},kg, clearly ruling out this candidate. All of the other classic DM candidates -- from scalar and pseudo-scalar spin 1/2 and spin 2 gauge singlets to nuclearitic strange quark ``bowling balls'' -- can be ruled out. Axions tailored to solve the CP-problem also cannot be invoked, no matter what mass is considered.

We also analyze the complexity of the less general case where the screen size is constant, the number of on-screen sprites is constant, and the game engine forgets the state of everything substantially off-screen, as in most, if not all, Super Mario Bros. video games. In this case we prove that the game is solvable in polynomial time, assuming levels are explicitly encoded; on the other hand, if levels can be represented using run-length encoding, then the problem is weakly NP-hard (even if levels have only constant height, as in the video games). All of our hardness proofs are also resilient to known glitches in Super Mario Bros., unlike the previous NP-hardness proof.},

	abstract = {It is well known that fighting a fire is a hard task. The Firefighter problem asks how to optimally deploy firefighters to defend the vertices of a graph from a fire. This problem is NP-Complete on all but a few classes of graphs. Thankfully, firefighters do not have to work alone, and are often aided by the efforts of good natured civilians who slow the spread of a fire by maintaining firebreaks when they are able. We will show that this help, although well-intentioned, unfortunately makes the optimal deployment of firefighters an even harder problem. To model this scenario we introduce the Temporal Firefighter problem, an extension of Firefighter to temporal graphs. We show that Temporal Firefighter is also NP-Complete, and remains so on all but one of the underlying classes of graphs on which Firefighter is known to have polynomial time solutions. This motivates us to explore making use of the temporal structure of the graph in our search for tractability, and we conclude by presenting an FPT algorithm for Temporal Firefighter with respect to the temporal graph parameter vertex-interval-membership-width.},

	abstract = {Some Olympic sports, like the marathon, are purely feats of human athleticism. But in others such as gymnastics, athletes channel their athleticism into a routine of skills. In these disciplines, designing the highest-scoring routine can be a challenging problem, because the routines are judged via a combination of artistic merit, which is largely subjective, and technical difficulty, which comes with complicated but objective scoring rules.

Notably, since the 2006 Code of Points, FIG (International Gymnastics Federation) has sought to make gymnastics scoring more objective by encoding more of the score in those objective technical side of scoring, and in this paper, we show how that push is reflected in the computational complexity of routine optimization.

Here, we analyze the purely-technical component of the scoring rules of routines in 17 different events across 5 Olympic sports. We identify four attributes that classify the common rules found in scoring functions, and, for each combination of attributes, prove hardness results or provide algorithms for designing the highest-scoring routine according to the objective technical component of the scoring functions. Ultimately, we discover that optimal routine construction for events in artistic, rhythmic, and trampoline gymnastics is NP-hard, while optimal routine construction for all other sports is in P.},
